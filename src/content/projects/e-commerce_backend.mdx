The backend of this e-commerce application is built using Node.js with Express.js as the primary web framework. Utilized Apollo Server for implementing a GraphQL API, enabling efficient data retrieval and manipulation. AWS SDK is integrated for seamless interaction with Amazon Web Services, while bcrypt ensures secure password hashing for user authentication.
